Yeah, there's 50 days. The others... Ah, no. No, I was talking about the overall portfolio, my man. Not about the amount of... Ah. All right. I got you. But remember there's other stuff that we sit on triggers? Yeah, yeah. Can you just approve my request? I asked you about the balance because the crypto market skyrocketed high over the weekend. So you see, 7%, 7%, 8%, 6%. So I asked you about the balance to understand. Okay. What is the situation? So that's good. We have 50K outside the market. Yep. I will buy... I will buy a little bit more over here. Mm-hmm. Just check the triggers. Is that coming through the money? It will not be triggered. I mean, all the crypto markets skyrocketed high. There is no way that it will be triggered. Market is boiling, my man. So I wanted to share with you a few things, but I forgot that you have interview right now. So all good.
