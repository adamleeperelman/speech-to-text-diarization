00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,720
[SPEAKER_00] Hello?

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,320
[SPEAKER_00] Good day, Chris. This is Ron. How are you doing, my man?

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,900
[SPEAKER_01] Good, and you, Ron?

4
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:20,079
[SPEAKER_00] I'm doing great. Is that a good time to talk, or are you around by any chance?

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:28,460
[SPEAKER_01] Mate, I've got quarter past. I've got ten minutes, then I'm going for that interview that they postponed on Friday.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,759
[SPEAKER_00] Ah, okay, okay, okay. No worries. I just want to double-check with you one thing, okay?

7
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,740
[SPEAKER_00] So we're not having a long conversation now.

8
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,640
[SPEAKER_00] You wrote me that you have 64,000 US inside Binance and 50,000 Australian dollars inside Swiftex, right?

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,539
[SPEAKER_00] Yes.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,399
[SPEAKER_00] But it should be wrong. I mean, you should have more than that.

11
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,939
[SPEAKER_01] In where?

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,159
[SPEAKER_01] You need to have more...

13
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,840
[SPEAKER_01] I transferred on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,700
[SPEAKER_01] 48, 48 and 48 over.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:11,140
[SPEAKER_00] Okay, and before that we transfer as well, like 50. So you need to have like 200,000 Australian dollars inside Binance.

16
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,140
[SPEAKER_00] And 70 grand around... even more right now because the crypto market skyrocketed high.

17
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:23,579
[SPEAKER_00] So I need to have like 80 around inside Swiftex. That's why it doesn't make sense.

18
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,000
[SPEAKER_00] And I wanted to ring you to double-check. Are you able to connect with me?

19
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,939
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, for like one, two minutes. Just to double-check that everything is okay.

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,700
[SPEAKER_00] Alright.

21
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:44,260
[SPEAKER_00] We are standing in a very good time. I don't know if you follow whatever happened in the crypto market. It just skyrocketed high quite a lot.

22
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,859
[SPEAKER_00] We had massive news that happens and comes from Trump.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:56,099
[SPEAKER_00] We're not going to confuse you before your interview because I wonder if you will be prepared and fully on the interview.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,859
[SPEAKER_00] And I will share with you that later on tonight.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,599
[SPEAKER_00] But let's just double-check and making sure that everything is in the right place.

26
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:08,719
[SPEAKER_00] I don't want that... I don't know, you will have any hacking or anything like that or someone took money from the exchange.

27
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,639
[SPEAKER_00] Okay.

28
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,479
[SPEAKER_00] And security code is CO2005.

29
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,259
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,259
[SPEAKER_01] Sorry about that.

31
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,580
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

32
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:42,879
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,719
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

34
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:48,740
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

35
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:48,860
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

36
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,280
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,300
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

38
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,780
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

39
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,719
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

40
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:52,479
[SPEAKER_00] Sorry about that.

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, and sign in, yeah.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,199
[SPEAKER_00] Does change?

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,580
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah.

44
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,840
[SPEAKER_00] Tap into the best of us.

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,819
[SPEAKER_01] Dashboard.

46
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:52,139
[SPEAKER_00] Okay.

47
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,300
[SPEAKER_00] Overall performance, 4,301.

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
[SPEAKER_00] Can I take over real quick?

49
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,719
[SPEAKER_01] Yep.

50
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,180
[SPEAKER_00] One second.

51
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,919
[SPEAKER_00] So we see you have more than 50.

52
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,539
[SPEAKER_00] You told me that you have 50, mate.

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,519
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, there's 50 there.

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,480
[SPEAKER_00] The others...

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,100
[SPEAKER_01] Ah, no.

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,360
[SPEAKER_00] No, I was talking about the overall portfolio, my man.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,379
[SPEAKER_00] Not about the amount.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
[SPEAKER_01] Ah, all right.

59
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,279
[SPEAKER_01] I got you.

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,339
[SPEAKER_01] But remember,

61
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,220
[SPEAKER_01] there's other stuff that we sit on triggers.

62
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,720
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,120
[SPEAKER_00] Can you just approve my request?

64
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,839
[SPEAKER_00] I asked you about the balance

65
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,360
[SPEAKER_00] because the crypto market skyrocketed high over the weekend.

66
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,160
[SPEAKER_00] So you see, 7%, 7%, 8%, 6%.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,860
[SPEAKER_00] So I asked you about the balance

68
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,759
[SPEAKER_00] to understand what is the situation.

69
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:54,519
[SPEAKER_00] So that's good.

70
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,660
[SPEAKER_00] 50K outside the market.

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,079
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,959
[SPEAKER_00] So I will buy...

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,839
[SPEAKER_00] I will buy a little bit more over here.

74
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,860
[SPEAKER_00] Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,660
[SPEAKER_01] Just check the triggers.

76
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,740
[SPEAKER_01] Is that coming through the money?

77
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,060
[SPEAKER_00] It will not be triggered.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,680
[SPEAKER_00] I mean, all the crypto markets skyrocketed high.

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,300
[SPEAKER_00] There is no way that it will be triggered.

80
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,060
[SPEAKER_00] Market is boiling, my man.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,420
[SPEAKER_00] So I wanted to share with you a few things,

82
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,379
[SPEAKER_00] but I forgot that you have interview right now.

83
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,199
[SPEAKER_00] So all good.

84
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,519
[SPEAKER_00] Just spoke with you a little bit more crypto.

85
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,319
[SPEAKER_00] Let's go over to wallet again.

86
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,600
[SPEAKER_00] What about Trump?

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,639
[SPEAKER_00] Trump, 8%, mate.

88
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:42,459
[SPEAKER_00] Up.

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,300

[SPEAKER_00] Okay.

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,279
[SPEAKER_00] Okay.

100
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,420
[SPEAKER_00] Go to...

101
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:58,899
[SPEAKER_00] Binance.

102
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,459
[SPEAKER_00] Let me just double check that everything is correct over there.

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,199
[SPEAKER_01] Yes.

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,439
[SPEAKER_00] Speak to you later.

155
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,199
[SPEAKER_00] Bye, my mate.

156
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,019
[SPEAKER_01] Yes, man.

157
