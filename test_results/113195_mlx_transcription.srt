1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,699
[SPEAKER_00] Hello?

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,320
[SPEAKER_01] Good day, Chris. This is Ron. How are you doing, my man?

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,900
[SPEAKER_00] Good, and you, Ron?

4
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:20,059
[SPEAKER_01] I'm doing great. Is that a good time to talk, or are you around by any chance?

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:28,460
[SPEAKER_00] Mate, I've got quarter past. I've got ten minutes, then I'm going for that interview that they postponed on Friday.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,740
[SPEAKER_01] Ah, okay, okay, okay. No worries. I just want to double-check with you one thing, okay?

7
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,740
[SPEAKER_01] So we're not having a long conversation now.

8
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,640
[SPEAKER_01] You wrote me that you have 64,000 US inside Binance and 50,000 Australian dollars inside SwiftX, right?

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,539
[SPEAKER_01] Yes.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,399
[SPEAKER_01] But it should be wrong. I mean, you should have more than that.

11
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:52,960
[SPEAKER_00] In where?

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,159
[SPEAKER_00] You need to have more...

13
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,840
[SPEAKER_00] I transferred on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,700
[SPEAKER_00] 48, 48 and 48 over.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:11,140
[SPEAKER_01] Okay, and before that we transfer as well, like 50. So you need to have like 200,000 Australian dollars inside Binance.

16
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,140
[SPEAKER_01] And 70 grand around... even more right now because the crypto market skyrocketed high.

17
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,599
[SPEAKER_01] So I need to have like 80 around inside SwiftX. That's why it doesn't make sense.

18
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,000
[SPEAKER_01] And I wanted to ring you to double-check. Are you able to connect with me?

19
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,939
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, for like one, two minutes. Just to double-check that everything is okay.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,700
[SPEAKER_01] Alright.

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,299
[SPEAKER_01] We are standing in a very good time. I don't know if you follow whatever happened in the crypto market.

22
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,260
[SPEAKER_01] It just skyrocketed in high quite a lot.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,859
[SPEAKER_01] We had massive news that happens and comes from Trump.

24
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:56,099
[SPEAKER_01] We're not going to confuse you before your interview because I wonder if you will be prepared and fully on the interview.

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,859
[SPEAKER_01] And I will share with you that later on tonight.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,599
[SPEAKER_01] But let's just double-check and making sure that everything is in the right place.

27
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:08,699
[SPEAKER_01] I don't want that... I don't know if you will have any hacking or anything like that or someone took money from the exchange.

28
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,659
[SPEAKER_00] Okay.

29
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,479
[SPEAKER_01] And security code is CO2005.

30
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,199
[SPEAKER_00] Oh, sorry.

31
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:34,780
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,099
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

34
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:43,180
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

35
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:44,139
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,120
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

37
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:46,060
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

38
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:46,280
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,340
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

40
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:46,500
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,539
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

42
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,300
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,680
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,479
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

45
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,379
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,759
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

47
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,020
[SPEAKER_00] Oh sorry.

48
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,240
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, and sign in, yeah.

49
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,219
[SPEAKER_01] That's James.

50
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,599
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

51
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:34,780
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

52
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,819
[SPEAKER_01] Depends to the best of us.

53
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:44,819
[SPEAKER_00] Dashboard.

54
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,180
[SPEAKER_01] Okay.

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,219
[SPEAKER_01] Overall performance, 4,301.

56
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,280
[SPEAKER_01] Can I take over real quick?

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,719
[SPEAKER_00] Yep.

58
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,199
[SPEAKER_01] One second.

59
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,919
[SPEAKER_01] So we see you have more than 50.

60
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,539
[SPEAKER_01] You wrote that you have 50, mate.

61
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,560
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, there's 50 days.

62
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,480
[SPEAKER_01] The others...

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,100
[SPEAKER_00] Ah, no.

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,379
[SPEAKER_01] No, I was talking about the overall portfolio, my man.

65
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,759
[SPEAKER_01] Not about the amount of...

66
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:22,819
[SPEAKER_01] Ah.

67
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:23,980
[SPEAKER_00] All right.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,300
[SPEAKER_00] I got you.

69
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,220
[SPEAKER_00] But remember there's other stuff that we sit on triggers?

70
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, yeah.

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,120
[SPEAKER_01] Can you just approve my request?

72
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:46,339
[SPEAKER_01] I asked you about the balance because the crypto market skyrocketed high over the weekend.

73
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,160
[SPEAKER_01] So you see, 7%, 7%, 8%, 6%.

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,500
[SPEAKER_01] So I asked you about the balance to understand.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,000
[SPEAKER_01] Okay.

76
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:53,819
[SPEAKER_01] What is the situation?

77
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,519
[SPEAKER_01] So that's good.

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,660
[SPEAKER_01] We have 50K outside the market.

79
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:58,259
[SPEAKER_01] Yep.

80
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,959
[SPEAKER_01] I will buy...

81
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,819
[SPEAKER_01] I will buy a little bit more over here.

82
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,879
[SPEAKER_01] Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,660
[SPEAKER_00] Just check the triggers.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,699
[SPEAKER_00] Is that coming through the money?

85
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,060
[SPEAKER_01] It will not be triggered.

86
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,680
[SPEAKER_01] I mean, all the crypto markets skyrocketed high.

87
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,319
[SPEAKER_01] There is no way that it will be triggered.

88
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,060
[SPEAKER_01] Market is boiling, my man.

89
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,420
[SPEAKER_01] So I wanted to share with you a few things, but I forgot that you have interview right now.

90
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,160
[SPEAKER_01] So all good.

91
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,480
[SPEAKER_01] Just spoke with you a little bit more crypto.

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,300
[SPEAKER_01] Let's go over to wallet again.

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,579
[SPEAKER_00] What about Trump?

94
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,639
[SPEAKER_01] Trump, 8%, mate.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,459
[SPEAKER_00] Up.

96
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,339
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

97
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,279
[SPEAKER_01] See?

98
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,379
[SPEAKER_01] Ethereum, 8%.

99
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,980
[SPEAKER_01] XRP, 3%.

100
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,480
[SPEAKER_01] 7% Solana.

101
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,699
[SPEAKER_01] Bitcoin.

102
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:52,439
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah.

103
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:52,920
[SPEAKER_01] Okay.

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,759
[SPEAKER_01] Go to...

105
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,060
[SPEAKER_01] We finished with SwiftX for now.

106
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,860
[SPEAKER_01] Go to Binance.

107
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,480
[SPEAKER_01] Let me just double check that everything is correct over there.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,079
[SPEAKER_00] Yes, Binance.

109
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,519
[SPEAKER_00] I already logged in.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
[SPEAKER_00] And I was looking at this.

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,300
[SPEAKER_00] Also what?

112
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:09,920
[SPEAKER_01] Ethereum.

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,300
[SPEAKER_01] You already Ethereum on your SwiftX account.

114
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,720
[SPEAKER_01] I bought with you Friday.

115
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,060
[SPEAKER_01] Okay.

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,399
[SPEAKER_01] I will take over.

117
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,740
[SPEAKER_01] Take you to the right place.

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,560
[SPEAKER_00] Oh shit.

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,139

[SPEAKER_00] Oh shit.

124
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,639
[SPEAKER_00] Oh shit.

125
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,379
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

126
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:40,759
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

127
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:40,779
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

128
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:40,959
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

129
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,839
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,079
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

135
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,279
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:49,839
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

137
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,759
[SPEAKER_01] Oh shit.

138
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,819
[SPEAKER_01] 7,000 Australian after all the fees

139
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,379
[SPEAKER_01] that you paid just until now.

140
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,360
[SPEAKER_01] Roughly around 3%.

141
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,819
[SPEAKER_01] Just until now.

142
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,079
[SPEAKER_01] Okay?

143
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,819
[SPEAKER_01] More to come. I will share with you all

144
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,000
[SPEAKER_01] the information later on today.

145
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,860
[SPEAKER_01] We are probably going to make a big move

146
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,800
[SPEAKER_01] as well on Trump coin.

147
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,019
[SPEAKER_01] Trump is going to come with a big statement.

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,519
[SPEAKER_01] So I will share that with you.

149
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,720
[SPEAKER_01] We scheduled a call for

150
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
[SPEAKER_01] 7 o'clock

151
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,540
[SPEAKER_01] later on tonight.

152
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,620
[SPEAKER_01] If you are around

153
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,819
[SPEAKER_01] before, shoot me a text.

154
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,439
[SPEAKER_01] Alright. I'll do that.

155
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,459
[SPEAKER_01] Beautiful, my man. And good luck

156
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,079
[SPEAKER_01] in the interview, my man. All the best.

157
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,560
[SPEAKER_00] Thanks, Ron. Speak to you later then.

158
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,199
[SPEAKER_01] Speak to you later. Bye, my mate.

159
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,339
[SPEAKER_00] Yes, man. Bye.
