00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:11,080 [Speaker 0]
[phone ringing] 

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,380 [Speaker 0]
Hello? 

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,780 [Speaker 1]
Good day, Chris. This is Ron. How are you doing, my man? 

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,180 [Speaker 0]
Good, and you, Ron? 

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,720 [Speaker 1]
Uh, I'm doing great. Uh, is that a good time to talk? Are you around by any chance? 

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,700 [Speaker 0]
Mate, I've got quarter past... I've got 10 minutes, then I'm going for that interview that they postponed on Friday. 

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:36,640 [Speaker 1]
Ah, okay, okay, okay. No worries. Eh, I just want to just double check with you one thing, okay? 

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:36,820 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:46,839 [Speaker 1]
So not to have a long conversation now. You wrote me that you have 64,000 US inside Binance, and 50,000 Australian dollar inside Swift X, right? 

00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,100 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,980 [Speaker 1]
Uh, but it should be wrong. I mean, you should have more than that. 

00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,960 [Speaker 0]
In where? In where? 

00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,580 [Speaker 1]
You need to have more in- 

00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:03,720 [Speaker 0]
I transferred on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 48, 48, and 48 over. 

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:20,300 [Speaker 1]
Okay. And before that we transfer as well, like, 50. So you need to have, like, 200,000 Australian dollar inside, um, inside Binance. And, uh, 70 grand around, uh... Or even more right now because the crypto market has skyrocketed high. 

00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,360 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:34,940 [Speaker 1]
We need to have, like, 80 around inside Swift X. That's why it doesn't make sense. And, uh, I wanted to ring you to double check. Are you able to connect with me, uh, for, like, one, two minutes just to double check that everything is okay? 

00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,380 [Speaker 0]
All right. 

00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:47,460 [Speaker 1]
We are standing in a very good time. I don't know if you follow whatever happen in the crypto market. It just, uh, skyrocketing high quite a lot. Uh, we had massive news- 

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:47,540 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:01:47,540 --> 00:02:11,960 [Speaker 1]
... that happens and comes from Trump. Not to confuse you before your interview, because I want that you will be [laughs], eh, prepared and, uh, fully on the interview, and I will share with you that later on tonight. Eh, but let's just double check, eh, making sure that everything in the right place. I don't want that, I don't know, you will have any hacking or anything like that, or someone took money from the exchange. 

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:22,940 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Now let me check. Mm. 

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:34,940 [Speaker 1]
Uh, security code is CO2805. 

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:44,240 [Speaker 0]
Okay, yep, that's fine. 

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,140 [Speaker 1]
Uh, 

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:59,160 [Speaker 1]
yeah. So I will just go over this. Okay? This 

00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,410 [Speaker 1]
is all 

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:20,240 [Speaker 1]
Okay? Yeah, and sign in. Yep. [sighs] 

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:34,960 [Speaker 1]
Just changed? 

00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,120 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,160 [Speaker 1]
Happens to the best of us. 

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,860 [Speaker 2]
Because, 

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,920 [Speaker 2]
um, I'm trying to 

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:52,870 [Speaker 3]
Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to try to close the deal. 

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:52,870 [Speaker 2]
Right, close. 

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:52,870 [Speaker 3]
Close? 

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,460 [Speaker 2]
Close. But first, um, take it easy, man. 

00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,590 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Overall performance, 4,301. 

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,080 [Speaker 2]
See? It's true. It's true, John. It's true. 

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,300 [Speaker 1]
Let me see. I tell you. 

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,720 [Speaker 2]
So- 

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,000 [Speaker 1]
Can I take over real quick? 

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,720 [Speaker 0]
See these numbers. Yep. 

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,900 [Speaker 1]
Uh, one second. 

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,019 [Speaker 1]
So we see you have more than 50. You wrote me that you have 50, mate. 

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,040 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, there's 50 there. The others is 50. 

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,940 [Speaker 1]
Ah, no. No, I was talking about the overall portfolio, my man. Not about the amount of money. 

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:34,820 [Speaker 0]
Oh, oh. All right. I got you. But remember, there's, there's other stuff that we set on triggers. 

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,859 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. Um, can you just, uh, pull my request? 

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,700 [Speaker 2]
Uh, what 

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,969 [Speaker 2]
do I do? 

00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:59,280 [Speaker 1]
I ask you about the balance because the crypto market skyrocketed high over the weekend. So we see 7%, 7%, 8%, 6%. So I ask you about the balance to understand what is the situation. So that's good. Uh, 50K outside the market. 

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,450 [Speaker 0]
Uh. 

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,860 [Speaker 1]
Eh, I will buy... I will buy a little bit more 

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,920 [Speaker 1]
over here. 

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,180 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,580 [Speaker 0]
Just check the triggers. Is that coming through the... They, they send money? 

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,600 [Speaker 1]
It will not be triggered. I mean, all the crypto market has skyrocketed high. Uh, there is no- 

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:20,950 [Speaker 0]
All right. 

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:31,190 [Speaker 1]
... almost no way that, uh, it will be triggered. Market is boiling, my man. So I wanted to share with you few things, but I forgot that you have interview right now. So, all good. 

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,220 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:39,320 [Speaker 1]
Just bought me a little bit more crypto. Um, let's go over to wallet again. 

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,719 [Speaker 0]
What about Trump? 

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,660 [Speaker 1]
Trump? Eight percent, mate, up. 

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,700 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,580 [Speaker 1]
See? Ethereum eight percent- 

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,590 [Speaker 0]
Eight percent. 

00:05:48,590 --> 00:06:04,539 [Speaker 1]
... uh, XRP three percent, seven percent Solana, Bitcoin. Yeah, okay. Um, go to... We're finished with Swift X for now. Uh, go to Binance. Let me just double check that everything is correct over there. 

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,080 [Speaker 0]
Yes, Binance. I already logged in, and I was looking at this. It get... Oh, also what? 

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,460 [Speaker 1]
Ethereum. You already, you already Ethereum- 

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,469 [Speaker 0]
Th- 

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:17,200 [Speaker 1]
... in the, on your Swift X account. 

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,310 [Speaker 0]
Oh, okay. 

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,660 [Speaker 1]
I bought it Friday. Um, okay. 

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:20,700 [Speaker 0]
So- 

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,340 [Speaker 1]
Go... I will take over. Take you to the right place. 

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:35,219 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Overview. Okay. 

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,620 [Speaker 2]
Okay, however, he was still working on the other one. So, 

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,160 [Speaker 1]
Okay. All right. Here you are in profit of, like, 3,000 Australian. On, uh- 

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,500 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm 

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,700 [Speaker 1]
... Swift X you are in a profit of 

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,600 [Speaker 1]
4,000 Australian. 

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,870 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:59,040 [Speaker 1]
Roughly around 7,000 Australian after all the fees that you paid just until now. Roughly around, uh, three- 

00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,050 [Speaker 0]
Uh-huh 

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,740 [Speaker 1]
... three percent just until now. Right? 

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:03,950 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:16,010 [Speaker 1]
More to come. I will share with you all the information later on today. Okay? Uh, we are probably going to make a big move as well on the... on Trump coin. Trump is going to count with a big statement, so I will share that with you. Um- 

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,020 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,320 [Speaker 1]
