# Speech-to-Text with MLX-Whisper (Apple Silicon Optimized)
# 
# IMPORTANT: This replaces standard whisperx/faster-whisper due to MPS compatibility issues
# on Apple Silicon M-series chips. MLX is Apple's framework specifically optimized for
# Apple Silicon and provides better performance and compatibility.

# MLX-Whisper for transcription (Apple Silicon optimized)
mlx-whisper>=0.3.0

# PyAnnote Audio for speaker diarization (works with PyTorch MPS)
pyannote.audio>=3.1

# PyTorch with MPS support (for PyAnnote only)
torch>=2.0.0
torchaudio>=2.0.0

# Audio processing
librosa>=0.10.0
